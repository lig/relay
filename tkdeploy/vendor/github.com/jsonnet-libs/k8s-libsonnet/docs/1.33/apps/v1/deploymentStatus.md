## Fields

### fn withAvailableReplicas

```ts
withAvailableReplicas(availableReplicas)
```

"Total number of available non-terminating pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment."

### fn withCollisionCount

```ts
withCollisionCount(collisionCount)
```

"Count of hash collisions for the Deployment. The Deployment controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ReplicaSet."

### fn withConditions

```ts
withConditions(conditions)
```

"Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state."

### fn withConditionsMixin

```ts
withConditionsMixin(conditions)
```

"Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

"The generation observed by the deployment controller."

### fn withReadyReplicas

```ts
withReadyReplicas(readyReplicas)
```

"Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this Deployment with a Ready Condition."

### fn withReplicas

```ts
withReplicas(replicas)
```

"Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment (their labels match the selector)."

### fn withTerminatingReplicas

```ts
withTerminatingReplicas(terminatingReplicas)
```

"Total number of terminating pods targeted by this deployment. Terminating pods have a non-null .metadata.deletionTimestamp and have not yet reached the Failed or Succeeded .status.phase.\n\nThis is an alpha field. Enable DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas to be able to use this field."

### fn withUnavailableReplicas

```ts
withUnavailableReplicas(unavailableReplicas)
```

"Total number of unavailable pods targeted by this deployment. This is the total number of pods that are still required for the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either be pods that are running but not yet available or pods that still have not been created."

### fn withUpdatedReplicas

```ts
withUpdatedReplicas(updatedReplicas)
```

"Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment that have the desired template spec."
